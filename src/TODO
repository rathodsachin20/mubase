Desperate dirty fix in unification --- do not delete the redundant node

IndexAttrProp : to be corrected; did quick fix for equality predicates

if the plangroup requires a indexorder physical prop, then no algorithms
need be applied -- taken care of in a ugly way ... need to think of a
better solution.

schemas not maintained properly

DIRTY FIX: we keep the name of the aggregate attribute as the name
of the aggregated attribute --- simplifies matters for cascaded
attributes. We assume only max/min type of aggregations so that the
maxval/minval/numDistinct properties of the attribute remain the same
after aggregation.

Best plan for an eq-class, phy-prop is the best among the plans for
strictly this phy-prop and for any further phy-props. One needs to check
plans for stronger physical properties unless it is guaranteed that the
plans for the stronger physical properties are guaranteed to be more
expensive.

MUST apply algorithm before enforcer for completeness. This is because
of the comebacks at a node. It is necessary that all the
algorithm-rooted plans be generated before the comeback which can occur
only during enforcer-rooted plan generation.

When checking if a physical property is present, check attribute representatives

Selectivities need to be improved --- e.g. for equating two attributes

How to take care of already existing physical properties while computing
cost of the enforcer

Tidy up the expression hierarchy --- separate boolean expressions from
arithmetic expressions
