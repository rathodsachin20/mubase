1. Maintain attribute equivalences as logical properties of the EQ nodes 
   (along with the schema). Attribute equivalences are computed (at the same 
   point as schema) based on the predicate applied (by unifying the input 
   attribute equivalence classes). Given an attribute index in the schema 
   it should be possible to access it's equivalence class in O(1). The
   attribute equivalence class maintains the index (in the schema) of the
   "head" attribute.

   In future, we can also maintain a list of functional dependencies as
   part of the LogProp.

   Attribute equivalence classes and FDs help us reduce the order 
   properties and order requirements to canonical form and compare.
