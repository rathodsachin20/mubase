To do a make, go to Optimizer/tests and run make

Executables created by make ...

perfeval: just prints out the numbers. Costlimit set as a large number.
    perfeval <algoname> < <queryfile>

driver: prints out the plan
    driver <algoname> <costlimit> < <queryfile>


queries/scripts/results are in TPCD-RESULTS
       TPCD:                     basic TPCD queries (q2, q2-decor, q11, q15)
    			(The queries q3,q5,q7,q9 and q10 are also here.
			 These are used for batch queries)
       TPCD-RESULTS/TPCD-COMP:   batched TPCD queries (both forward and
	       				reverse sequences of queries)
       TPCD-RESULTS/STAG:        scale up queries

       Note: to get time for sharability computations look at
        TPCD-RESULTS/REPORTS/rep-nomqo.  Here, for greeedy, compute
	     USRT+SYST - (PHYDAGUSR + PHYDAGSYS + LOGDAGUSR + LOGDAGSYS)
        These were (in ms):  10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 basically negligible)

         (for actual queries being used, look at TPCD-RESULTS/genout)

       Note:  all queries used the catalog in TPCD-RESULTS/Catalog.
        The catalog also specifies indices.  We specified indices on
	the primary keys.

        Note also that we don't do projection in the optimizer
	currently, and the Catalog fakes this by reducing the sizes of
	fields that are not used at all in the queries.  The space
	occupied by the database relations are not decreased however, 
	so we are not cheating here.
        
To run the optimizers execute
    genout
Note: perf output dump stored in dir OUT. Also OUT is linked to tests/GRAPHS/OUT

To generate ascii reports execute
    genreps
The reports are generated in tests/TPCD-RESULTS/REPORTS

To generate graphs run
    tests/GRAPHS/gengraphdata
and then login to prasan@ashwini and execute JGRAPH/gengraphs there 
(because jgraph only available for solaris).
The script 
	JGRAPHS/gengraphs (on ashwini) 
first rcp's the DATA directory and then creates the .ps files in dir PS

Finally, copy the PS directory into the directory graphs wherever the
paper resides (currently prasan@info-0:ICDE2000/).

GRAPHS/DATA contains the plottable data generated by
    GENDATA-SCRIPTS/{gendata, gendata-rev-min,gendata-rev-avg} which are 
    used respectively when only the fwd or fwd/rev avg is considered.
    We use gendata-rev-min currently, which takes min of forward and
    reverse numbers.
